Welcome to Jekyll!
Where should I start? Jekyll is so much fun! I stumbled upon it while working on my Skillcrush Git Course. Git is such a great tool and so very powerful. A section of the blueprint gave me some added info on Git Pages, which I was familiar with but had no idea on how great the service was. After a couple of Google searches I found Jekyll and how they could make my blogging easy and without the use of Wordpress. Don't get me wrong, I love Wordpress it's what I am studying but there is just something about the simplicity and minimalistic style Git Pages and Jekyll have to offer. Smashing Magazine was a big help and the article I used to get up and running was invaluable. I was up in no time! So for my first blog post I need to put into words how excited the process made me feel. I also feel like such a badass doing it all in terminal with my new skills from the Skillcrush blueprint. I can't say enough about Jekyll, it's wonderful, please check it out!

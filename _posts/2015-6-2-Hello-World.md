title: Welcome to Jekyll!
---

Where should I start? Jekyll is so much fun, I stumbled apon it while working on my Skillcrush git course. Git is such a great tool and so very powerful. A section of the blueprint gave me some added info on Git Pages which I was familiar with but had no idea on how great the service was.  After a couple of google searches I found Jekyll and how they could make my blogging easy and without wordpress.  Dont get me wrong I love wordpress it's what I am studying. But there is just something about the simplicity and minimalistic style. Smashing magazine was a big help and the article I used to get up and running was invaluable. I was up in no time!  So for my first blog post I need to put into words how excited the process made me feel. Also I feel like such a badass doing it all in terminal with my new skills from the Skillcrush blueprint. Jekyll is wonderful please check it out!
